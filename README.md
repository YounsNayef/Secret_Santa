# 🎄 Secret Santa Generator

Hey there! I made this super simple Secret Santa program to help organize gift exchanges with friends and family. No more drawing names out of a hat! 😄

## What's Cool About It?
- 🎁 Super easy to use - just type names and go!
- 🤫 Shows assignments one at a time (no peeking!)
- ✨ Smart enough to make sure you don't get yourself
- 👥 Works with any group of 3 or more people
- 🎯 Keeps things totally random and fair

## Getting Started
1. Got Python? You'll need it! (If not, grab it from python.org)
2. Download the `secret_santa.py` file
3. Open your terminal/command prompt and type:
   ```bash
   python secret_santa.py
   ```
4. Just follow along and type in everyone's names
5. When it's time for the big reveal, gather everyone around!

## Here's What It Looks Like
```
